# Banking System Terminal

A simple terminal-based banking system built in C++ as a hobby project.

## What I Learned

- Practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++ (classes, encapsulation, abstraction)
- Worked with string manipulation functions and core C++ fundamentals
- Learned how to install, compile, and run a C++ project locally
- Reconstructed programming concepts I already knew from JavaScript, but applied them using C++ syntax
